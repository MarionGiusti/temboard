Temboard is designed to interact with many components: systemd, PostgreSQL,
agents, etc.

As we are trying to find the right balance between innovation and backward
compatibility, we define a comprehensive list of platforms and software that
we support for each version.

Temboard 9 is not yet released.

Each minor release (e.g. `9.1`, `9.2`, etc.) is compatible with the following
components:

|                |                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| Linux          | Debian 11 and 12, RHEL 8 and 9 |
| Python         | 3.6+                           |
| Postgres       | 10 to 16                       |
| Temboard Agent | 8.2 and 9.X                    |

For older systems, you may use [temBoard v8](/en/v8).
